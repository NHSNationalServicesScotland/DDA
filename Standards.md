# Standards
All NSS digital output will be developed in line with the following principles.

## Data
### Data Management
The production, management and dissemination of official statistics should meet the requirements of informed decision-making by government, public services, business, researchers and the public.

### Open Data Standards
Make all non-personal, non-commercially sensitive data from the service available for re-use by others under an appropriate licence.

## IT
### Identity
NSS Identity Management will provide a secure, efficient Digital Identity to NSS staff which will enable access to NSS Digital Services. It will follow recognised international standards such as OAuth, SAML and OpenID.
